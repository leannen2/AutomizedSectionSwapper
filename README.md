## Project Log

**Mar 28: Research & Brainstorm Algorithms to Implement**
1. [Johnson's Circuit Finding Algorithm](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150GA/homeworks/hw1/Johnson%2075.PDF)finds all simple cycles in graph in linear time.

## Brainstorm

1. Create Graph class
2. Create StudentNode class
3. Write/Find algorithm to find all simple cycles in graph (Idea: Johnson's Algo)
4. Write/Find algorithm to find the best combination of simple cycles that include the most number of StudentNodes
